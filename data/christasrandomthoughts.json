{"title": "Gotta love health issues...🙄", "date": "Friday, December 8, 2023", "text": "So I have another kidney stone 🙃 just found out at the ER yesterday because of being in quite a bit of pain and nauseated 🤢 from it. Honestly getting and dealing with kidney stones don't surprise me anymore 🙃 I live with them 🙃 Being told from the doctor immediately after seeing me that I'm dehydrated was a first, but honestly I don't stay hydrated well at all, so its not surprising that I was dehydrated as well 🙃 However there was some news I got that was a huge wake ⏰ up call 📞 for me and I'm going to be working on changing things to avoid it getting worse while I can now, because I honestly don't want anything to do with the health scare at all. Its not going to be easy for me to change what I need to, but it is necessary for me to do. Also, being called obese and not overweight is not something I'm used to and I'm not a fan of hearing about myself. Brings back memories of being bullied in elementary school 🏫 when I was younger and it hurts. This morning 🌄 I'm dealing with an earache and hoping it goes away soon and doesn't get worse 🙃"},

I also need the job to be full-time and not part-time, because I can't make ends meet with it being part-time...I would have to have two part-time jobs and they would have to both actually give me 20 hours or more all the time to make it work out as well as both pay me $15 or more. Also would love another job where if I got overtime in it I wouldn't get into trouble for it. As I'm job hunting again, I will be working my content creator, online work, crafting, mystery shopping, and livestreaming jobs full-time as well, because when I do that they actually pay well and make it to where I can live off of it."},

{"title": "Stressing out about my job situation again... ", "date": "Friday, November 24, 2023", "text": "So, I'm kinda in a pickle at work again and now feel like I'm going to lose my job again, based on what the stocking manager told me she was going to start doing with stockers. She is going to start writing them up for not stocking 25 boxes an hour (on a normal stocking day) as well as write ups for things not being put on the correct uboats and pallets on truck day. So, based on what she said yesterday, she most likely wrote me up, because I had a uboat that had 57 boxes on it...meaning it should have taken me 2 and a half hours to complete it. But it took me my entire shift. Meaning because I'm on super thin ice at work because of previous write ups... I'm going to lose my job with a write up for not stocking boxes fast enough now. I shouldn't let this get to me, but it is. I shouldn't be overthinking, but I am. I am the one that kinda put myself in this position, because of a post I made on the Dollar Tree reddit page asking for the number to report violations annousmously and my store manager saw it and asked me about it. So, I ended up telling her what I felt like were violations through text and told her I was just getting the number in case I wasn't confident enough to go to her about them yet and that I hadn't called anything in...she said I could if I wanted to though... I mentioned that I wanted to come to her first which is why I was waiting to call. I did mention to her about what the stocking manager said and how now I feel like I'm going to lose my job because of a write up from her and how I really don't want that to happen. She didn't reply to that yet, but to be fair yesterday was Thanksgiving. But I did mention to her how I wanted to just be put on truck days instead if it means I have less chance to lose my job from being wrote up for not stocking enough boxes an hour. I hate it though, because I really need more then 5 hours a week at work. 25 hours at work has actually brought me in enough money to pay bills and save some money as well, but now I'm going to lose that if I lose my job for another write up or go back to just 5 hours a week. I mentioned how I would like better training on how to know how many boxes an hour I'm stocking an hour before I would feel comfortable stocking again and not worrying about being wrote up and losing my job. I love stocking as a job. I want to continue working stocking. I actually do like working at Dollar Tree (in particuallary the store I'm working at because of the employees and most costumers I know because they come in all the time). But *sighs* I'm stressing out and feeling like I'm going to be fired before my vacation in a few days or if I somehow get lucky and don't lose my job and just lose hours (even though they have hours because of the holiday) I'm going to be upset because I need more then 5 hours a week...25 hours a week has been amazing to have this past month... Anyways, I need to finish getting ready for work this morning... I just needed to get this out... because it has me stressing out and crying... and I've had a super crappy week in general and have just been kinda quiet and hiding and avoiding people."},

Which in turns gives them $10 to start with on the site to try it out and get one free drink. Your friend must in turn spend $15 in real money (not free drinks) in order to qualify. But once done, you will earn a free drink from your friend joining and qualifying.As you can see, you can also pay to promote your profile, to help give you a better ranking and help you earn more money on the site. I personally haven't done, this yet. I'm just seeing what I can earn first without paying to promote my profile right now.Note: There may be a referral link in this post where I will receive a small incentive if you use it."},

Assuming I can't find another full time job and have to deal with two part time jobs to make a full time job income for a little while work. Because I'm tired of not making enough money and having to stay under 40 hours a week between working two stores when I need the money coming in to pay bills and other needs like getting my moped fixed, getting a new phone, paying back a friend that I owe money too, building a savings again, etc..."},

{"title": "Crumble Cookies 🍪 from the week of May 20, 2023 Review ", "date": "Sunday, May 21, 2023", "text": "Here is my review of the four cookies from Crumble Cookies this week.I want to start out by saying that I didn't get a before picture of them when I got them. I only got a picture of them after I got them home. So, they got a little bit melted on the way home (because of it being 81*F out) and jumped around some in the box (because of the drive home on my moped), but they are still good. I also want to say thank you to my best friend/sister Otter for getting these for me to try.I do not know the name of the mystery cookie. My review and rankings of the four cookies: Mystery Cookie: Tasty cookie and cute sprinkles on top. I would get it again.Honey Cake Cookie: Tasty cookie. Love the look of it with the teddy grahams on top of it. I would definitely get this one again.Chocolate Mallow Cupcake Cookie: You can't go wrong with a chocolate cookie and the fact that it looks like one of the chocolate cupcakes sold in stores makes it cute. I would get this one again.Peanut Butter Cookie: You can't go wrong with a peanut butter cookie that has snickers on top. I would definitely get this one again.My rankings for the cookies are: 1) Honey Cake Cookie2) Peanut Butter Cookie3) Chocolate Mallow Cupcake Cookie4) Mystery CookieAbout the mystery cookie: What the cookies looked like when I got them home (I didn't get a picture of them when I first got them :( ): About the other three cookies:"},
{"title": "Crumble Cookies 🍪 from 4/21/23 ", "date": "Thursday, May 11, 2023", "text": "My friend Otter told me about these and got them for me.I love to do reviews and would have done a video review, but wasn't able to do that. So, I'm doing the next best thing and posting a review with what I thought of them along with the pictures of them that I was able to get at the time. Hope you all enjoy and feel free to leave your thoughts on them with me in the comments, if you tried them when they were out. These were very yummy cookies.I can see me getting them again if they come back to Crumble Cookies.My review for them is below, with the names of them.Did you try these cookies when they were out?What did you think of them?Cotton Candy - Pretty cookie, but would have preferred it on a chocolate cookie. I preferred the topping over the cookie. But would get this again. One thumb up.Peanut Butter Munch - This is a good lucking cookie. The cookie tastes great and so does the topping. I would get this cookie again. Two thumbs up. Birthday Cake - This was my favorite from the topping to the cookie. I would get this cookie again. Two thumbs up.Caramel Shortbread - This cookie looked good and tasted really good as well. I would get this cookie again. Two thumbs up. If I had to rate them in the order I liked them instead of how many thumbs up it would be the following:1) Birthday Cake2) Caramel Shortbread3) Peanut Butter Munch4) Cotton Candy Honestly the top three are in a tie for first place in my opinion, with the fourth one in second place."},
{"title": "Big moped 🛵 accomplishment yesterday - 4/28/23 ", "date": "Saturday, April 29, 2023", "text": "So yesterday was a big accomplishment for me when I drove to work because of the rain 🌧 and a little bit of wind that was 10+ish (the wind wasn't constant so that helped alot, because when the wind speed is 10+ and constant I try and avoid driving) just like when it was raining 🌧 how it was yesterday. But I didn't avoid it yesterday 👀😮😮😮 I actually drove in it and dealt with it for the first time. The puddles sucked on two wheels because there were a few I couldn't avoid and I noticed my wheels slipped more in them, so I drove a bit slower in them. I also did attempt to wear a new rain 🌧 poncho that I got from Walmart, but it didn't work out well, because it was blowing in the wind and making it to where it blocked my views in my mirrors and I didn't feel safe putting up with that when I was dealing with the rain how I was, so I stopped and took it off. Not to mention I was pretty much soaked a good bit at that point 👀🙄🤣 But I don't think I could have done it without alot of encouragement from my friend Brian Croxford because I do everything I can to avoid it, but being reminded that there are others who drive in things like that daily on mopeds as well and how much I spent on it with not driving it, means my money is being wasted at that point, so I'm trying to do better and get more experience and confidence with driving in rain like yesterday as well as wind (10+) but also just driving in general helps a TON with experience and confidence. Here is a short 10 second video 📹 so you can see 👀 how it was raining 🌧 yesterday so you have a better understanding what I drove in 👀🛵"},

I am in a place with things going on (on the back burners...that I'm trying not to stress about), where I need more money coming in then I currently have (don't get me wrong...they have been giving me more hours lately...but it still isn't consistent...)so I have to cover my bases and find something that works better for me.
