The file cabinet needs to be replaced as the top drawer mechanism is breaking but I do try to go through many of the files once a year. The bottom drawer though is genealogy mostly and just sits there pretty packed.Decided that two 5 gallon paint containers left by the sellers in the garage laundry/storage room are unusable and will go to the hazardous waste disposal next week along with some pesticide containers.

Had all the electrical, plumbing and termite damage identified in the home inspection fixed and also treated for termites.\u00a0Replaced the sump pump and had the furnace hung to avoid further flooding damage. Did an earthquake retrofit and completely re-landscaped the yard front and back including adding new hardscape and trying to improve drainage to avoid future flooding in the crawl space.We celebrated with and hosted family and friends. Provided some child care and simply enjoyed our grandchildren and the ease of short visits with them, our son and DIL. Found the services and providers we needed. Learned our way around. Found our exercise routines and walked the dog many times a day which helped us meet people. We think we have met some potential good friends.\u00a0Identified a few go to restaurants for take out. Explored a bit.

Hubby continued to fine tune heating by getting a different style floor register for one spot and slightly adjusting the duct dampers ourselves. We also replaced a broken electric space heater as sometimes you just want to warm up the space where you are.He also worked on getting hot water in the shower without running a lot of cold first by adjusting the temperature mixer and then we were able to turn down the water heater temperature. I was pleasantly surprised to see on this month\u2019s gas bill that we stayed in the lowest rate band despite using the furnace a lot.\u00a0Although everything else is electric including 2 space heaters, we were successful in making the majority of our electricity use fall into the lowest rate time frame.\u00a0Other frugal things1. Spent way too much time getting the lint off a king size fleece blanket that sheds when washed. I use it over the down comforter as the dog gets on the bed and it is nice and warm. I tried replacing it but sent two different new ones back for various reasons. So we have this one, a lint brush, my time and savings.2. Returned an item bought as a gift and used a box we had saved.

This week lots of plants were put in the ground including the beautiful silver sheen in the corner.

Then the drip irrigation will be set up and bark mulch put down.The yard is looking great and the pup is enjoying it both for running and sniffing. It is mostly an adult space, but future owners could easily convert some areas into play spaces by replacing gravel with real or artificial grass.\u00a0We bought 3 of the benches in the top photo which are very comfortable. We will be getting a small black metal patio table back from our son and have some chairs and a patio umbrella. Also an outdoor rug that was left with the house. We ordered hoses for the front and back even though the plants will be on drip irrigation as there will still be uses for them.The railings for the old concrete patio stairs still need to be selected and installed. We are holding off on repainting the old patio until we see what it is like during the rainy season this winter after pressure washing.We have been diligent about returning any items we don\u2019t use for the yard project within the return window, giving things away and patiently putting trash and green waste out each week to minimize our dump hauling cost. The dump haul won\u2019t happen until we are sure no more waste will be generated by the project and we hope to share a load with a neighbor.Taking care of our stuff:\u00a0I washed and put back together the dog\u2019s favorite bed which will probably last another 6 months or so as he digs at it trying to bury his favorite toy and that is destroying the foam inside. It was a gift from former neighbors after their cat rejected it. We will look for a similar bed once it falls apart as he likes it so much.Discretionary expenses:\u00a0I replaced our king size down comforter by purchasing one from The Company Store during their 30% off sale so the cost was $300.

The city came through with approval of the correct one quickly though and there was no delay. Once the work is done and approved we can apply for a partial refund of our city transfer tax but you only have a year from purchase to do that. We should also get a discount on our earthquake insurance.What is involved in an earthquake retrofit? For our home design it involves cripple wall bracing and foundation bolting. Our chimney would still likely fall down but addressing the chimney and its soft mortar is down the road as we don\u2019t use the fireplace. The info below is from the California Earthquake Authority website.\u00a0Cripple Wall BracingCripple walls\u00a0are short walls that rest on a house\u2019s foundation and support the floor and exterior walls. When these walls are not braced, they may shift during an earthquake. When this occurs, the chances of severe damage to your house and injury to individuals increases. Bracing cripple walls strengthens structures by increasing stability, and the process typically helps minimize damage to houses. See the image above to understand how new elements in the crawl space enhance the house's earthquake resistance.Foundation BoltingHouses that aren't bolted to their foundation can move during an earthquake. Houses that move off their foundation will cause significant damage and may be costly to repair. The bolting process requires that holes are drilled through the sill plate on a foundation and anchor bolts are installed. Sometimes, there isn't enough space to drill, and steel plates will also need to be attached. These bolts must be properly installed to be effective.\"},\r\n{\"title\": \"You can give away almost anything!\", \"date\": \"Tuesday, October 17, 2023\", \"text\": \"I continue to be amazed at what I can give away through my Buy Nothing group!

We are figuring out when to open which windows to cool down the house. I did run the heat to take the chill off the house on Tuesday morning before the heatwave arrived. Reprogramming the thermostat was successful although I may tweak the settings a bit as it gets colder here.Our property tax bill arrived. We knew it would be huge but seeing the number is another thing. Just a reinforcement to watch our other expenses. The county still has to apply another credit/adjustment related to the sale price of our previous house but that will be relatively small.Home/yard project expenses were only two inexpensive items for minor home improvements and one bag of topsoil. We both worked on the yard a lot to move things along and save money. Hoping to be ready to buy compost, plants and mulch this week.The hardscape is all done and paid for! We put two old patio chairs on the new back patio and are enjoying sitting in the shade.We are trying to get rid of the 2nd large batch of rubbish from the yard project without paying a lot for hauling. So far I posted 5 pallets and crate pieces on Buy Nothing and someone says they want them. Hoping they do take them. I also cleaned up most of a pile of old rock and will use a bit before posting the rest. We are going to try to sell the leftover flagstone pieces once we are sure we don\u2019t need any of them. We have used a couple so far to help with drainage and stop erosion. Our trash can is small so the rest will be disposed of bit by bit over many weeks and by paying someone to do a dump haul.We received our free COVID tests and they are good until late January. I also got 2 boxes from the library that expire earlier so we are covered for now.We purchased a little food, a few household supplies, beer, and no toiletries.

There were more surprises in the destruction of the old front yard.Why put weed cloth, soil, black plastic, soil, more weed cloth, and then more soil down? We are astonished anything grew there!Why would you pile dirt against the bottom chimney bricks and mortar in a wet climate? It is not surprising the mortar needs repointing!Why were there old termite bait stations all over the yard yet there still was a termite problem? At least we have already addressed that with termite treatment that actually works.We are taking care of all of this and more but \ud83d\ude1fI was busy all week but my to do list is pretty much unchanged although a couple of things did move forward. What did I do besides read and tend to the dog and house? I got my flu shot and as usual didn\u2019t feel well for a short while. Two down (RSV and flu) and only Covid to go.\u00a0I did the Trader Joe\u2019s shopping this week and am enjoying pumpkin waffles. Of all the pumpkin items they had I only bought 2 boxes of those and some cans of pumpkin for baking.We got the earthquake retrofit work scheduled for the third week of October so that will be our last big new home expense until we get our updated retroactive property tax bill.\u00a0The pup got groomed and had a great time doing so.

Right now it seems the sequence is to pressure wash, lightly sand with an orbital sander, vacuum and wash again, perhaps prime depending on what the surface is like, and then paint with an anti-slip acrylic coating. The final coat can be made any of their colors so that is a plus. Our son lent us a handheld power orbital sander to test on a small area. Then we will decide how much of this to do ourselves as we could rent a larger orbital sander that you stand up to use and our landscaper will pressure wash.

She is going to start writing them up for not stocking 25 boxes an hour (on a normal stocking day) as well as write ups for things not being put on the correct uboats and pallets on truck day. So, based on what she said yesterday, she most likely wrote me up, because I had a uboat that had 57 boxes on it...meaning it should have taken me 2 and a half hours to complete it. But it took me my entire shift. Meaning because I'm on super thin ice at work because of previous write ups... I'm going to lose my job with a write up for not stocking boxes fast enough now. I shouldn't let this get to me, but it is. I shouldn't be overthinking, but I am. I am the one that kinda put myself in this position, because of a post I made on the Dollar Tree reddit page asking for the number to report violations annousmously and my store manager saw it and asked me about it. So, I ended up telling her what I felt like were violations through text and told her I was just getting the number in case I wasn't confident enough to go to her about them yet and that I hadn't called anything in...she said I could if I wanted to though... I mentioned that I wanted to come to her first which is why I was waiting to call. I did mention to her about what the stocking manager said and how now I feel like I'm going to lose my job because of a write up from her and how I really don't want that to happen. She didn't reply to that yet, but to be fair yesterday was Thanksgiving. But I did mention to her how I wanted to just be put on truck days instead if it means I have less chance to lose my job from being wrote up for not stocking enough boxes an hour. I hate it though, because I really need more then 5 hours a week at work. 25 hours at work has actually brought me in enough money to pay bills and save some money as well, but now I'm going to lose that if I lose my job for another write up or go back to just 5 hours a week. I mentioned how I would like better training on how to know how many boxes an hour I'm stocking an hour before I would feel comfortable stocking again and not worrying about being wrote up and losing my job.

But I didn't avoid it yesterday \ud83d\udc40\ud83d\ude2e\ud83d\ude2e\ud83d\ude2e I actually drove in it and dealt with it for the first time. The puddles sucked on two wheels because there were a few I couldn't avoid and I noticed my wheels slipped more in them, so I drove a bit slower in them. I also did attempt to wear a new rain \ud83c\udf27 poncho that I got from Walmart, but it didn't work out well, because it was blowing in the wind and making it to where it blocked my views in my mirrors and I didn't feel safe putting up with that when I was dealing with the rain how I was, so I stopped and took it off. Not to mention I was pretty much soaked a good bit at that point \ud83d\udc40\ud83d\ude44\ud83e\udd23 But I don't think I could have done it without alot of encouragement from my friend Brian Croxford because I do everything I can to avoid it, but being reminded that there are others who drive in things like that daily on mopeds as well and how much I spent on it with not driving it, means my money is being wasted at that point, so I'm trying to do better and get more experience and confidence with driving in rain like yesterday as well as wind (10+) but also just driving in general helps a TON with experience and confidence.
