The file cabinet needs to be replaced as the top drawer mechanism is breaking but I do try to go through many of the files once a year. The bottom drawer though is genealogy mostly and just sits there pretty packed.Decided that two 5 gallon paint containers left by the sellers in the garage laundry/storage room are unusable and will go to the hazardous waste disposal next week along with some pesticide containers. Still need to assess the smaller paint cans."},

Bought and sold houses both with 30 day escrows. Moved from southern Cal to Northern Cal with a puppy using U-haul after giving away lots of stuff. Gave away lots more after the move. Had all the electrical, plumbing and termite damage identified in the home inspection fixed and also treated for termites.¬†Replaced the sump pump and had the furnace hung to avoid further flooding damage. Did an earthquake retrofit and completely re-landscaped the yard front and back including adding new hardscape and trying to improve drainage to avoid future flooding in the crawl space.We celebrated with and hosted family and friends. Provided some child care and simply enjoyed our grandchildren and the ease of short visits with them, our son and DIL. Found the services and providers we needed. Learned our way around. Found our exercise routines and walked the dog many times a day which helped us meet people. We think we have met some potential good friends.¬†Identified a few go to restaurants for take out. Explored a bit. Made an effort to stay connected to the friends and family we left behind and farther flung ones.We were at once stressed, tired, worried about the amount we were spending and delighted that we had moved to a nice home with nice neighbors and near our younger son and his family.¬†We are so ready for an easier year full of joy and connections and less work LOL.Happy New Year and wishing that you get all you want from 2024!"},

After the first hard rain since we moved in we found a leak at one of the windows. Hubby was able to caulk the opening after it dried out. Another rain and it didn‚Äôt leak!2. The long piece of what I thought was metal threshold left in the garage turned out to be kitchen cabinet baseboard and end caps. The cabinet installation by the previous owner was a bit sloppy in places and there was no end cap in the most visible spot. Hubby cut one of the new pieces to fit and it is visually much better. We need a dab of glue to hold it though and will have to buy some.3. I was given loose tea from Portugal for Christmas and thought of using our French press to steep it as I have no teapot. Worked fine and the tea is quite nice.4. ¬†üßùüéÖüç™One of Santa‚Äôs elves left a bag of cookies on our porch Christmas Eve. I suspect the main elf is about 9 years old and lives up the street. Will be investigating the identity of the elves so we can thank them and let them know they are delicious.5.

Sounds like it will be perfect for us and provide a dose of live holiday music.Fine Tuning the HouseWe continued to adjust our use of gas, electricity and water primarily for environmental reasons but also to minimize spending while staying comfortable.¬†This house has a gas furnace, water heater and stove. Hubby continued to fine tune heating by getting a different style floor register for one spot and slightly adjusting the duct dampers ourselves. We also replaced a broken electric space heater as sometimes you just want to warm up the space where you are.He also worked on getting hot water in the shower without running a lot of cold first by adjusting the temperature mixer and then we were able to turn down the water heater temperature. I was pleasantly surprised to see on this month‚Äôs gas bill that we stayed in the lowest rate band despite using the furnace a lot.¬†Although everything else is electric including 2 space heaters, we were successful in making the majority of our electricity use fall into the lowest rate time frame.¬†Other frugal things1. Spent way too much time getting the lint off a king size fleece blanket that sheds when washed. I use it over the down comforter as the dog gets on the bed and it is nice and warm. I tried replacing it but sent two different new ones back for various reasons. So we have this one, a lint brush, my time and savings.2. Returned an item bought as a gift and used a box we had saved. After shipping it is only a partial refund but still worth it.3. Skipped a holiday gathering that felt more like an obligation than fun. It also required both a food contribution and a cash donation.4. Accepted some free tangerines and they were delicious."},

The ferry ride was short and very pleasant.Almost all Christmas gifts have arrived and been wrapped.¬†Hubby put together the 3rd bench for the backyard.

Clearly I walked a lot more than that as I only carry my phone on actual outdoor walks. There were also lots of stair climbs with a two story house again.My back hurts less.¬†Pilates sessions with a very good trainer is addressing the issue well. Much thanks to my son for finding this trainer who diagnoses and customizes extremely well. I like her as a person too.So much for reducing grocery costs in November:¬†I thought we could keep our November grocery, household, toiletries and alcohol spending similar to October. I was way off.¬†Having 2 more adults to feed for a week, Hubby‚Äôs birthday dinner party for 7, and providing significant hors d‚Äôoeuvres for Thanksgiving added almost $200 to our spending for the month. Happily spent I should add as the family time was lovely and fun. Today is my local DIL‚Äôs 40th birthday party so, although my older son is sick and stayed home, my DIl is back for 2 nights. They will be gone much of December and January visiting her parents which makes these visits all the more precious.¬†We still have spent less in these categories this year than last and I have lowered the budget goal a bit further for 2024.Insurance costs and coverage: Once we decided not to switch insurance companies we took a close look at our homeowners, earthquake and excess liability policies. Raise a deductible here and get an earthquake retrofit discount there and it adds up. Plus we noticed the earthquake insurance still listed us as owning 2 homes (there was a few weeks overlap) instead of one and the homeowners insurance had not noted the recent roof replacement.¬†Now I just have to go to city hall and get copies of all the permits for the property and hope there is one for updating water pipes!Speaking of city hall: I submitted the form and documentation to get part of our city transfer tax refunded because of the retrofit. This is enough money to care about.The county is slow: Still no word on our property tax credit for seniors who sold and bought a home in California. We are owed a discount on our property tax and submitted the form 7 months ago. To be fair, they did say it would take at least 6 months.Our 2 year old furnace is oversized: With colder weather we have discovered that the expensive furnace the sellers put in is about 50% oversized so it was shutting down because it got too hot. Hubby found an experienced technician knowledgeable about this brand and he was able to make an adjustment to the gas flow so it works ok and doesn‚Äôt overheat. Whew. We did not want to have to buy a new furnace.Planning for 2024:¬†The new year definitely will see me focusing away from the house and yard. I‚Äôm starting to get excited about it!"},

I‚Äôm not showing the pre-existing patio because it is bare at the moment since it is quite chilly these days.Eventually there will be tall shrubs providing a screen along the back fence plus the camellias and other plants blooming.

Every surface is dusty and it even is inside some kitchen drawers, etc. The yard project made all the screens and windows filthy on the outside too.I don‚Äôt expect to get it all done in one month but it really needs focused work and effort. I‚Äôll look for decluttering and reorganizing options as I go.

At that time they lived in Kenya and live in Taiwan now. We haven‚Äôt met his younger daughter and only he made the trip this time. It was great to catch up in person and he got to meet our son‚Äôs family for the first time.Home Improvement Projects:¬†We are near the finish line with our yard project. This week lots of plants were put in the ground including the beautiful silver sheen in the corner. Our son and DIL gave it to us as it was already too large for their yard.¬†We still need to select and purchase the smaller plants and get them in the ground. Then the drip irrigation will be set up and bark mulch put down.The yard is looking great and the pup is enjoying it both for running and sniffing. It is mostly an adult space, but future owners could easily convert some areas into play spaces by replacing gravel with real or artificial grass.¬†We bought 3 of the benches in the top photo which are very comfortable. We will be getting a small black metal patio table back from our son and have some chairs and a patio umbrella. Also an outdoor rug that was left with the house. We ordered hoses for the front and back even though the plants will be on drip irrigation as there will still be uses for them.The railings for the old concrete patio stairs still need to be selected and installed. We are holding off on repainting the old patio until we see what it is like during the rainy season this winter after pressure washing.We have been diligent about returning any items we don‚Äôt use for the yard project within the return window, giving things away and patiently putting trash and green waste out each week to minimize our dump hauling cost. The dump haul won‚Äôt happen until we are sure no more waste will be generated by the project and we hope to share a load with a neighbor.Taking care of our stuff:¬†I washed and put back together the dog‚Äôs favorite bed which will probably last another 6 months or so as he digs at it trying to bury his favorite toy and that is destroying the foam inside. It was a gift from former neighbors after their cat rejected it. We will look for a similar bed once it falls apart as he likes it so much.Discretionary expenses:¬†I replaced our king size down comforter by purchasing one from The Company Store during their 30% off sale so the cost was $300. The king size one we have had for 6 years doesn‚Äôt have fill in some areas anymore as it seems to have migrated! Made for not so cozy nights. We really like the queen size one we purchased from The Company Store so I called and made sure I was buying the same weight. They were able to look it up even after 3 years.Food, household, toiletries & alcohol purchases:¬†Very happy with our total three quarters of the way through the month. We did go out for pizza one night with our son and the baby which was a nice break ¬†and our treat but is a separate part of our budget.

{"title": "Earthquake Retrofit - The drilling, sawing and nailing begin", "date": "Friday, October 20, 2023", "text": "The earthquake retrofit, the final costly project, started today!¬†We were a bit concerned it would be delayed when we learned earlier this week that they submitted the wrong info for the permit. The city came through with approval of the correct one quickly though and there was no delay. Once the work is done and approved we can apply for a partial refund of our city transfer tax but you only have a year from purchase to do that. We should also get a discount on our earthquake insurance.What is involved in an earthquake retrofit? For our home design it involves cripple wall bracing and foundation bolting. Our chimney would still likely fall down but addressing the chimney and its soft mortar is down the road as we don‚Äôt use the fireplace. The info below is from the California Earthquake Authority website.¬†Cripple Wall BracingCripple walls¬†are short walls that rest on a house‚Äôs foundation and support the floor and exterior walls. When these walls are not braced, they may shift during an earthquake. When this occurs, the chances of severe damage to your house and injury to individuals increases. Bracing cripple walls strengthens structures by increasing stability, and the process typically helps minimize damage to houses. See the image above to understand how new elements in the crawl space enhance the house's earthquake resistance.Foundation BoltingHouses that aren't bolted to their foundation can move during an earthquake. Houses that move off their foundation will cause significant damage and may be costly to repair. The bolting process requires that holes are drilled through the sill plate on a foundation and anchor bolts are installed. Sometimes, there isn't enough space to drill, and steel plates will also need to be attached. These bolts must be properly installed to be effective."},

They won that adventure at a silent auction and had a marvelous time on a beautiful day. I'm so glad we could give that to them.The baby was cheerful and took two good long naps. The big grand girl was lovely to spend time with and had a birthday party to attend from mid-afternoon until after dinner. A nice but tiring day. The pup came over for a while and was also good but couldn't settle into his afternoon nap. He actually wanted to go home for a rest lol.The yard continued!¬†The end is in sight. We agreed to a project price for the final phase. We bought soil amendment, edging, weed cloth, the major plants and 2 outdoor benches. Still to buy are the smaller plants, irrigation supplies and bark mulch. Planting began yesterday!Taking care of our stuff -¬†This week it was a $142 filter for the fancy furnace. We don‚Äôt have AC so that is just a once a year purchase.Discretionary expenses -¬†The socks I ordered last week arrived. I kept 2 packs identical to ones I am replacing and returned 4 of a different variety that weren‚Äôt what I expected. Also returned some jeans that didn‚Äôt fit and waterproofing shoe spray that required a different product to be used first. I do find shopping a painü§™ but I did order a pair of smart wool socks from REI mostly using my member credit.Food, household, toiletries & alcohol purchases¬†were higher this week as expected. I am hoping the pattern of lower and higher weeks continues low as we stock up and use things. That would cut our monthly expenses in this category significantly.¬†All meals were all at home except Sunday when Hubby got take out for lunch and dinner as we babysat all day and were feeling our age!¬†October week 2: $204.59 & Month to date: $309.68 vs $948 for all of September so we are doing better."},

The nap did happen but then I couldn't sleep all night so wished I had pushed through instead.Got the current Moderna Covid vaccine today so that is the last of the triumvirate of RSV, flu and Covid needed this fall.Once again my immune system has quickly kicked in and I feel tired and have a scratchy throat. To nap or not to nap is the question right now. The pup has no doubts about which to do!"},
{"title": "Thrifty Thursday plus more decluttering", "date": "Thursday, October 12, 2023", "text": "ThriftinessI‚Äôm on a mission to get a head start on saving money in 2024 so I kept a list of my successes.- When our son and the grandgirls came over to lunch Monday, Hubby immediately suggested takeout. I thawed soup and we had that with tuna sandwiches and cut up veggies and apple slices. Everyone was happy and full.- Planned dinners for the week again and we only grocery shopped for what was needed but of course the total was more than last week as we had used up a lot of things.- I suggested to a neighbor that we combine our dump hauling needs from our yard renovations to try to save money and she thinks it is a great idea.- I received 2 plastic kid size bowls from Buy Nothing for future grandbaby use. Now I just need toddler size utensils and sippy cups as I received plastic plates earlier.- We enjoyed our gifted third of an apple ü•ß¬†Decluttering- Making the hard decisions to get rid of mementos that I have no place for and that have been in my life forever. So far no regrets as my memories are still there but my house holds less. This week I gave away a wedding gift my parents received in 1945 and a picture I made in grade school that my Dad framed and hung in their last house (such an affirmation by my artistic Dad of my own abilities).-¬†The person who wanted the pallets picked them up but left the crate sides. That is ok as there are other things that have to be hauled away.- When I reach for something to use I am asking myself if the items surrounding it are useful to us now or are they just taking up space. Some specialized sewing supplies were given away after I had to dig past them to get what I actually needed for mending."},

I‚Äôve had lunch at that restaurant twice and drooled over their pies in the case but with just the 2 of us it was too much.

I was delighted to use the high chair we were given so our baby granddaughter could join us at lunch yesterday. She was quite happy about it herself."},
{"title": "Week 40: Monitoring our spending & enjoying fall heatwave", "date": "Sunday, October 8, 2023", "text": "We are to trying to be really mindful of our spending the rest of this year and all of next year while finishing the repairs and improvements for this house and yard - and having fun and good family and friend time.The last 4 days of this week were quite warm (highs of 87 to 91) and with the new balcony door blind the house handled it pretty well. We are figuring out when to open which windows to cool down the house. I did run the heat to take the chill off the house on Tuesday morning before the heatwave arrived. Reprogramming the thermostat was successful although I may tweak the settings a bit as it gets colder here.Our property tax bill arrived. We knew it would be huge but seeing the number is another thing. Just a reinforcement to watch our other expenses. The county still has to apply another credit/adjustment related to the sale price of our previous house but that will be relatively small.Home/yard project expenses were only two inexpensive items for minor home improvements and one bag of topsoil. We both worked on the yard a lot to move things along and save money. Hoping to be ready to buy compost, plants and mulch this week.The hardscape is all done and paid for! We put two old patio chairs on the new back patio and are enjoying sitting in the shade.We are trying to get rid of the 2nd large batch of rubbish from the yard project without paying a lot for hauling. So far I posted 5 pallets and crate pieces on Buy Nothing and someone says they want them. Hoping they do take them. I also cleaned up most of a pile of old rock and will use a bit before posting the rest. We are going to try to sell the leftover flagstone pieces once we are sure we don‚Äôt need any of them. We have used a couple so far to help with drainage and stop erosion. Our trash can is small so the rest will be disposed of bit by bit over many weeks and by paying someone to do a dump haul.We received our free COVID tests and they are good until late January. I also got 2 boxes from the library that expire earlier so we are covered for now.We purchased a little food, a few household supplies, beer, and no toiletries. In September we spent over $948 on those items. Our food, household and toiletries pantries are well stocked so we should be able to spend less each month the rest of the year. Sadly I had to throw out a 4 pack of sea bass because it smelled and had obviously thawed and then refrozen. No other food waste.Total for October week 1: $104.77 - which is a good start to the month.¬†Dinners were all at home.Pork chops ¬†with chutney, sweet potato and zucchiniShrimp cocktails with large dinner salads and garlic breadRavioli with broccoli¬†Turkey burgers on buns with sliced tomatoes and cooked spinachSalmon with broccoli and riceTurkey burgers on buns with sliced tomatoes, carrots and cornLentil and carrot soup with garlic bread , sliced pear and green salad"},

{"title": "Week 39: Hello October and big yard progress", "date": "Sunday, October 1, 2023", "text": "I took pictures of the backyard from the 2nd floor balcony and from the existing patio. Lots of progress. You can see where the plants will go and there will be a bench in the gravel area off the walk. More gravel and stones for the walk our front were delivered Friday. The end is in sight!The hard working landscapers, including Hubby, made huge progress though. It is kind of like a home painting project in the respect that you prep, prep some more, and then get to the nice part. There were more surprises in the destruction of the old front yard.Why put weed cloth, soil, black plastic, soil, more weed cloth, and then more soil down? We are astonished anything grew there!Why would you pile dirt against the bottom chimney bricks and mortar in a wet climate? It is not surprising the mortar needs repointing!Why were there old termite bait stations all over the yard yet there still was a termite problem? At least we have already addressed that with termite treatment that actually works.We are taking care of all of this and more but üòüI was busy all week but my to do list is pretty much unchanged although a couple of things did move forward. What did I do besides read and tend to the dog and house? I got my flu shot and as usual didn‚Äôt feel well for a short while. Two down (RSV and flu) and only Covid to go.¬†I did the Trader Joe‚Äôs shopping this week and am enjoying pumpkin waffles. Of all the pumpkin items they had I only bought 2 boxes of those and some cans of pumpkin for baking.We got the earthquake retrofit work scheduled for the third week of October so that will be our last big new home expense until we get our updated retroactive property tax bill.¬†The pup got groomed and had a great time doing so. I had some really nice chats with new acquaintances and came up with some storage space rearranging ideas that may help the house work better for us once I do them.Onward to the first week of October with a thankful heart and large bills still to come."},

I‚Äôm thankful for having meds on hand to deal with the side effects too.The availability nearby of a wide range of groceries and home supplies.Lovely sunny and warm weather these last few days.Seeing signs of Fall like the red leaf on the ground this morning.The nice people who stop and chat when I am walking the pup - most of them give him pets too which he loves.I‚Äôve mentioned this before but I marveled again this morning at how quiet and peaceful our new neighborhood is all the time."},
{"title": "Week 38: Smoky air, progress and plans", "date": "Sunday, September 24, 2023", "text": "An unusual weekWow, we had two really bad air quality days followed by several hours of ‚Äúunhealthy‚Äù air each day the rest of the week. It was smoke from wildfires in the far north of California and in southern Oregon.¬†Then we found out our landscaper is injured and can't do the planting work. The person doing the hardscape work will step in thankfully and Hubby is pitching in as much as he can so this can be done.¬†We agreed to a 10 hour day of babysitting both grand-girls in early October so son an DIL can go on a boat trip they won at a silent auction. Since the grand-baby burst into sobs when left with us briefly this week, we have concluded she has reached the stranger fear stage and we realized she had been asleep the last few times we were at their house. Ages in baby time since she was familiar with us being around lol. The plan is for me to spend big chunks of time at their house before babysitting so she is used to us again and we know her current schedule/likes/needs and how to use the high chair, etc. Babies change so fast at this age. As I told my 40 year old son, we haven‚Äôt taken care of a 7 month old baby since he was one!With lots of advice from the local Benjamin Moore store staff followed by internet reading, we have a tentative plan to fix the slippery paint on the large old concrete patio. Right now it seems the sequence is to pressure wash, lightly sand with an orbital sander, vacuum and wash again, perhaps prime depending on what the surface is like, and then paint with an anti-slip acrylic coating. The final coat can be made any of their colors so that is a plus. Our son lent us a handheld power orbital sander to test on a small area. Then we will decide how much of this to do ourselves as we could rent a larger orbital sander that you stand up to use and our landscaper will pressure wash. The store staff also carefully picked and recommended 3 small company painters for us to contact for bids if we want to hire a crew.Got stuff doneSon and the grand-girls came over for dinner Wednesday while DIL worked late.¬†Cleared off my desk and that checked off at least 7 things on my 20+ items still on our move to do list and also got pile of paperwork filed.Cleaned the high chair so it is ready to useExercised a bit more and ate fairly healthily¬†Bought 2 long sleeve tees after checking my wardrobe for fall. Decided to check out the local Marshalls before ordering anything else.We watched a video specific to our thermostat and reprogrammed it so fingers crossed it works correctly for us! No more coming on in the middle of the night when not needed hopefully.We agreed on the largest plants for back and front.Ate 6 of 7 planned dinners at home and got takeout from the local taco truck when son and girls were here.PLANS FOR WEEK 39Complete last week‚Äôs nagging tasks:¬†finish cleaning the kitchen appliances that came with the house (refrigerator coils vacuumed, dishwasher cleaned)complete more items left on move to do listExercise more before flu shot on ThursdayPlan all meals at homeTry sanding painted concrete and decide how to proceed with painting after earthquake retrofit work is doneGet paint chips for colors used on house so can pick patio color easilyMending/alterations doneClear off ‚Äúdonate or undecided‚Äù items on table in garageRearrange non clothing storage so I have more room for clothing in my closet and bedside tableAnd that is once again ambitious!"},
{"title": "Planning week 38!", "date": "Monday, September 18, 2023", "text": "I‚Äôve been feeling a bit down and lacking in motivation but accomplishing things always makes me feel better. Specifically I feel better when I exercise, can check things off the to do list or solve problems, eat fewer carbs, drink less caffeine or alcohol, and spend time with others. So let‚Äôs try those.Get stuff done -As usual I am overly optimistic about how much I will get done but that gives me options üòÅ1. Actually do my Pilates routine (I always mean to - really!). My sciatica is nagging at me and needs to stop.2. Plan time with family based on their schedule3. Get some nagging tasks done (clean off desk, clean out email by addressing old items, ¬†hem pants, deal with remaining pile of items in garage by deciding to keep or get rid of, clean gifted high chair).¬†4. Finish deep cleaning the kitchen appliances that came with the house (refrigerator coils vacuumed, dishwasher cleaned/checked - stove & oven are done).5. Order 3 long sleeve tees, more warm socks, warm cardigan and/or fleece vest so I am not cold this winter.6. Substitute healthier choices for carb, etc. cravings or eating habits.Solve a problem or two -1. Why is the heat suddenly going on in the middle of the night? I found the thermostat manual online and now need to understand it so we can fix this before we actually need heat! I did turn the system off this morning but that won‚Äôt work long term.2. Decide on at least the main plants for the front and back. Find out where to buy them.Plan Some Dinner Ideas - We have found ourselves uninspired lately when contemplating what to have for dinner which is fine but not very enjoyable. We like simple, fast meal prep and see leftovers as a bonus so here are this week‚Äôs ideas. We‚Äôll see what actually happens as we will get take out if we get together with the family).Green lentil and carrot soup - 2 mealsLeftover turkey burgers with carrots and peasShrimp with garlic, red pepper and broccoli over capellini¬†Tuna chef saladChicken breast with butternut squash and green beansSalmon with mashed potatoes and saladWhat do you hope to do this week?"}
